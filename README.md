- 👋 Hi, I’m Rabindra Parajuli, an ecologist by training, a geospatial data scientist by profession, and a nature enthusiast at heart— exploring the world through data and lens, both my camera and remote sensors.
- 🌱 I’m an avid learner of advanced cloud-based geospatial analysis in Google Earth Engine, actively working on geospatial modeling and time-series ecological forecasting, with an interest in applying AI-driven approaches for environmental monitoring and decision-making.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on integrating remote sensing and field data with machine learning to address ecological and biodiversity-related questions.
