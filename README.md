- 👋 Hi, I’m Rabindra Parajuli, an ecologist by training, a geospatial data scientist by profession, and a nature enthusiast at heart— exploring the world through data and camera lens.
- 👀 I’m interested in statistical and geospatial modeling applications and ecological forecasting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced geospatial analysis in Google Earth Engine (Python API) and ecological forecasting using deep learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on integrating remote sensing and field data to address ecological and biodiversity-related questions using machine learning applications.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out at parajuli.rabindra@gmail.com OR rabindra.parajuli@uga.edu
